title:  "Chocolate Covered Cherries"
image: 
tags: dessert, chocolate, cherries, cherry, christmas, seasonal

ingredients:
- 5 pounds of candy font sugar
- 1 pound of butter (softened at room temperature)
- 1/2 pint whipping cream (warmed)
- 74 oz. Maraschino cherries (quantity is dependant on the size of cherries and how much font you wrap around each cherry)
- 24 oz. pure chocolate chips
- 4-6 ounces blocks of paraffin wax (to allow hardening of chocolate with a sheen)
- 4 tbsp real butter
- Wax paper (for cooling chocolate dipped cherries)

directions:
- Mix butter and candy font sugar together
- Add 1/2 pint warm whipping cream
- Knead until nice and smooth. Will look like silk.
- Once knedaed, start taking this kneaded font mixture and rolling them into balls a little larger than your Marachino cherries.
- Flatten this ball into your left hand with a small dimple in the middle for the cherry.
- Carefully wrap the mixture around the sides of the cherry, gently connecting all edges around the cherries stem. Be careful not to remove or damage the stem.
- In a double broiler slowly heat up the chocolate chips with butter with some room left over for the wax.
- In another double broiler, slowly heat up the wax. It won't take long to become molten.
- With the chocolate and wax still molten, pour the wax into the chocolate. Mix slowly and thoroughly.
- While the chocolate and wax mixture is molten, start dipping the font covered cherries.
- Place chocolate covered cherries on wax paper to cool all the way.

This is an old Thielen Christmas recipe. One note to add is that this recipe is from an older era (as you can tell by the amount of paraffin wax). In modern times **some** wax is already added to most store bought chocolate chips. So... Is paraffin wax neccessary? I'll get back to you on that one after I find time to play with this.
