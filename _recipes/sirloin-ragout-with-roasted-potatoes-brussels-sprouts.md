title:  "Sirloin Ragout w/ Roasted Potatoes and Brussels Sprouts"
image: 
tags: main, dinner, steak, ragout, tomato
servings: 2
time: 35 min.
equipment: sauté pan, sheet pan, chef's knife, cutting board, parchment paper

ingredients:
- 2 x Sirloin steaks
- 2 tbsp Beef Seasoning
- One large garlic cloves
- 6 red potatoes
- Beef Stock Concentrate
- 1 can of Tomato Sauce (1 cup)
- 2-3 medium size carrots
- 1 onion
- 2-3 rosemary sprigs (dried rosemary works too)
- 6-8 Brussels sprouts
- butter
- Parchment Paper
- Olive oil
- Water
- Salt & Pepper to taste

directions:
- Wash, dry and prepare the vegetables. Peel and slice carrots into thick rounds. Quarter potatoes and cut brussels sprouts in half. Peel and chop onion into medium dice. Peel and finely chop garlic. 
- Strip leaves from the rosemary sprigs. Set aside a few springs for garnish.
- Heat oven to 425 F.
- Mix potatoes and Brussels sprouts together in a bowl. Add picked rosemary to the bowl. Season with a pinch of salt.
- Dice steak by slicing it into 4-5 strips, then turn steak and slice it again like a grid.
- Sprinkle steak seasoning liberally over diced steak.
- Place parchment paper on a sheet pan. Place potatoes and Brussels sprouts on the sheet pan. Spread out the potatoes and Brussels sprouts in an even layer. Bake for 20 minutes or until fork tender.
- While the vegetables are cooking, heat a sauté pan over medium high heat. A large walled sauté pan work good for this. Add about 1 tbsp of olive oil to the pan. Carefully arrange the diced steak in the pan so the pieces don’t touch. Cook for about 1 minute or until browned. Turn each piece over and repeated.
- Remove steak from the pan and rest on a plate. The steak should be rare to medium-rare. In the same sauté pan, reduce heat. Then add butter and let it melt. Add carrots, onion and garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes. Add tomato sauce and then add beef broth concentrate. Fill the empty tomato sauce can with hot tap water and add to the sauté pan.
- Add a dash of steak seasoning to the sauté pan and let the ragout cook together for about 10-12 minutes. Then return the steak to the pan.
- Remove the sheet pan from oven and check that potatoes and Brussels sprouts are tender.
- Divide the ragout into equal portions between two bowls or deep plates. Garnish with reserved rosemary springs.

Sirloin Ragout with Roasted Potatoes and Brussel Sprouts

Often cooked low and slow, ragouts are prepared with a variety of vegetables and seasonings. This hearty dish looks like a stew yet eats like a steak dinner. If you've got the time, however, the flavors only get better and better if they slowly simmer.

*Notes*
* For the beef seasonings, choose something robust and powerful to compliment the strong tomato, beef stock flavor.
* Use a walled sauté pan because you will be adding about 2 cups of liquid to a full pan that will need to be reduced.
