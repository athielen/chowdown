**Notes**
* Cinnamon comes in two basic types: Ceylon and cassia. Ceylon cinnamonâ€™s delicate, complex flavor is ideal for ice creams and simple sauces. The spicy, bolder cassia cinnamon (often labeled simply as cinnamon) is preferred for baking.
* Be careful not to overdo it on the nutmeg. A small amount of the spice goes a long way.
