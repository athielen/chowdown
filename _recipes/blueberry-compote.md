Compotes are similar to preserves in that it's made with fresh fruit over low heat in a sugar syrup to leave some fruit still intact. This can either be accomplished in saving half of your fruit to add in after breaking down the other half or cook slow while physically squashing half of the blueberries.

You can substitue out blueberries for almost any berry. Sugar quantity might have to be adjusted for more bitter berries.

**NOTE**: Add water sparingly to produce your desired viscosity. Less water equals thicker syrup.
