This simple cheesecake recipe comes from the 75th anniversary edition of "Joy of Cooking", one of the most influential American cookbooks.

It is a perfect beginners cheesecake because of the water-bath baking technique. This allows for a gradual baking that allows for a **large** window of success. The sign of a well baked cheesecake is the abscence of a crack on the top which this technique will allow for. Because of the water bath it produces a more creamy, moist cheesecake in contrast to a New York Style Cheesecake which is dense and almost dry.

The other facet of this being a beginners cheesecake is the oppurtunity for some improvisation. It's a simple recipe that produces a "blank slate". From this recipe you could start to substitue different zests in for the lemon, come up with different seasonally spiced crusts, various fruit toppings, addition of liquers with a cutback on the vanilla extract.


**Things I have tried**:
* Pumpkin spice in the crust during fall months
* Creamy caramelzied apples on top
* Instead of 2 tsp of vanilla, I've tried 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp baileys
* Vanilla wafer crust with raspberry desert sauce
* Use chocolate cookies for a crust for a chocolate base.

<br>
**Notes**: 
* Sift your sugar to remove lumps
* Get full fat sour cream
* Potentionally chill your graham cracker crust for 30 minutes before the adding of the cheesecake mixture to achieve a defined separation between the layers
* DO NOT remove the cheesecake immediately from the oven!
* ACTUALLY use a wooden spoon, not your ovens ajar position on it's hinge which maybe too large of a gap. You want as gradual of a temperature decline as possible.

**Tools**: Electric mixer, springform pan, large roasting pan, oven.
