tags: coffee

ingredients:
- 3 tbsp instant coffee
- 1/2 tsp xanthan gum
- 3 tbsp water
- 2 cups ice
- 1 cup milk
- 6 tbsp caramel sauce
- whipped cream and caramel sauce, to garnish

directions:
- Prepare the coffee roast, by mixing the instant coffee with 1 tbsp. of water.
- Prepare the frappuccino base by mixing xanthan gum with 2 tbsp. of water. (It’s okay to have lumps. They’ll disappear once blended.)
- Place the coffee roast, xanthan gum mixture, ice, milk, and caramel sauce into a blender. Blend on low speed for a few seconds, then on a max speed for about 10 seconds, or until the frappuccino is smooth.
- Pour into the cups and top with whipped cream and caramel sauce. Serve immediately.
